Project Overview

This project is a Sentiment Analysis classifier for movie reviews, aiming to predict whether a review is positive or negative.
The model is built using Deep Learning (LSTM) and tested on movie review datasets.

The focus of this project:

- Preprocessing raw movie review texts (tokenization, stopword removal, padding, etc.)

- Handling sequence length using 90th percentile padding

- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

- Performing inference on custom reviews
